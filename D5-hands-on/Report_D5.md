# Report of Day 5: HPL Benchmark

The HPL benchmark program solves a huge linear systems in double precision (64 bits) arithmetic on 
distributed-memory computers in order to evaluate the computational capacities of the node. In order to obtain a good performance the matrix dimension given as input shoud produce load that fill about the 75% of the RAM capacity.
