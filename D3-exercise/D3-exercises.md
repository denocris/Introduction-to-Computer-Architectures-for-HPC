============

Exercise 1
==========

- Develop a raw version of the transpose code for a square matrix.


Exercise 2
==========
  
- Implement a second version of the transpose code (the
  fast-transpose) including the cache friendly schema presented in
  class.  Check the performance difference for different matrix sizes
  (1024, 2048, 4096) and different buffer sizes.

Exercise 3
==========

- Develop a matrix-matrix multiplication code in c, using a buffer to
  store the columns of the second matrix. The order of loops should be
  such that you could reuse the buffer as much as possible.
